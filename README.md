# bitburner

Some helper scripts for use in a browser game about scripting and hacking - Bitburner. 
It uses Netscript 2.0, which is an in-game Javascript for writing your own code to interact with the game.

To people who know the game:
I also use other people's modified scripts, but I won't be posting it here as they are not mine.
